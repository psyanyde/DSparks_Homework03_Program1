Homework 3 – Program 01

The app allows the user to manage a list of college students and their majors. The app uses a SQLite database to store information. User can add, update, delete, and search student records. All data is stored locally. Closing and reopening the app keeps all previous data. Input fields have some error checking for empty or invalid entries. 

The main screen shows all students currently in the database. Buttons are on the screen to add a new student, add a new major, or search and filter current students.
